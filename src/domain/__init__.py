"""Domain layer - Core business logic and entities.

This package contains the core business logic of the transformer training system,
free from any external framework dependencies. It defines:

- Business entities (configurations, models)
- Repository interfaces for data access
- Service interfaces for business operations

The domain layer represents the "what" of the system - the core business rules
and entities that define the transformer training domain.
